# üê¶ Chirpy

## Description
Chirpy is a robust HTTP server built in Go that powers a microblogging platform. Think of it like Twitter, but simpler and more focused. Users can post short messages called "chirps" and we handle all the behind-the-scenes magic to make it work smoothly.

## Architecture
Our system is built like a well-organized restaurant:

### üè† Front Door (HTTP Server)
- Like a restaurant's entrance, this is where all requests come in
- Handles things like "I want to post a chirp" or "Show me all chirps"
- Makes sure people are who they say they are (authentication)

### üóÑÔ∏è Kitchen (Database)
- PostgreSQL database, like a restaurant's kitchen where all the ingredients are stored
- Keeps track of:
  - Users and their information
  - All the chirps people have posted
  - Who has premium membership (Chirpy Red)
  - Login tokens (like membership cards)

### üîí Security System
- JWT tokens (like special VIP passes that prove who you are)
- Password hashing (turns passwords into secret codes)
- API keys for external services (like special passwords for delivery partners)

### üí≥ Payment System
- Integration with Polka (our payment processor)
- Handles premium membership upgrades
- Like a cash register that talks to the bank

### üö¶ Traffic Control (Middleware)
- Checks if users are allowed to do certain things
- Counts how many people visit
- Like having security guards and people counters at the door

### Component Details

1. **Client Layer**
   - HTTP clients (browsers, apps) that send requests to our server

2. **HTTP Server Layer**
   - Router: Directs traffic to correct handlers
   - Auth: Checks user permissions
   - Handlers: Process requests
   - Metrics: Tracks usage

3. **Core Services**
   - User Service: Manages accounts
   - Chirp Service: Handles posts
   - Auth Service: Handles login/security
   - Payment Service: Manages subscriptions

4. **Database Layer**
   - Users: Stores account info
   - Chirps: Stores posts
   - Refresh Tokens: Manages sessions

5. **External Services**
   - Polka: Handles payments

## Why?
Modern social platforms are often bloated with features and complex infrastructure. Chirpy aims to:
- Keep things simple and clean
- Show how to build a secure and reliable service
- Make user data safe with proper login systems
- Store data efficiently using PostgreSQL
- Handle passwords securely (because nobody wants their account hacked!)

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```
3. Set up PostgreSQL and create a database named `chirpy`
4. Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   DB_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/chirpy?sslmode=disable"
   PLATFORM="dev"
   JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   POLKA_KEY="your-polka-api-key"
   ```
5. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   goose -dir sql/schema postgres "${DB_URL}" up
   ```
6. Run the server:
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

## Features

- Refresh tokens for staying logged in safely
- Content filtering (keeps things family-friendly)
- Email uniqueness (no duplicate accounts)
- Environment-based security
- Polka webhook authentication
