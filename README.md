# üê¶ Chirpy

## Description
Chirpy is a robust HTTP server built in Go that powers a microblogging platform. Think of it like Twitter, but simpler and more focused. Users can post short messages called "chirps" and we handle all the behind-the-scenes magic to make it work smoothly.

## Why?
Modern social platforms are often bloated with features and complex infrastructure. Chirpy aims to:
- Keep things simple and clean
- Show how to build a secure and reliable service
- Make user data safe with proper login systems
- Store data efficiently using PostgreSQL
- Handle passwords securely (because nobody wants their account hacked!)

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```
3. Set up PostgreSQL and create a database named `chirpy`
4. Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   DB_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/chirpy?sslmode=disable"
   PLATFORM="dev"
   JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   POLKA_KEY="your-polka-api-key"
   ```
5. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   goose -dir sql/schema postgres "${DB_URL}" up
   ```
6. Run the server:
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```
