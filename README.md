# üê¶ Chirpy

## Description
Chirpy is a robust HTTP server built in Go that powers a microblogging platform. It provides a RESTful API for creating and retrieving short messages called "chirps", along with secure user authentication.

## Why?
Modern social platforms are often bloated with features and complex infrastructure. Chirpy aims to:
- Demonstrate clean API design with Go
- Show how to build a maintainable microservice
- Implement secure user authentication with JWT
- Showcase PostgreSQL integration with type-safe queries
- Provide practical examples of password hashing and validation

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```
3. Set up PostgreSQL and create a database named `chirpy`
4. Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   DB_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/chirpy?sslmode=disable"
   PLATFORM="dev"
   JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   ```
5. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   goose -dir sql/schema postgres "${DB_URL}" up
   ```
6. Run the server:
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

## Usage

### Authentication
```http
POST /api/users
Create a new user with email and password
{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword"
}

POST /api/login
Login and get access & refresh tokens
{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword"
}

PUT /api/users
Update user's email and password (requires JWT)
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
{
    "email": "newemail@example.com",
    "password": "newpassword"
}

POST /api/refresh
Get new access token using refresh token
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <refresh_token>

POST /api/revoke
Revoke a refresh token
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <refresh_token>
```

### Chirps
```http
POST /api/chirps
Create a new chirp (requires JWT, 140 char limit)
{
    "body": "Hello world!"
}

GET /api/chirps
Get all chirps

GET /api/chirps/{chirpID}
Get a specific chirp

DELETE /api/chirps/{chirpID}
Delete a chirp (requires JWT, must be author)
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Admin
```http
GET /admin/metrics
View request metrics

POST /admin/reset
Reset database (dev only)
```

### Health Check
```http
GET /api/healthz
Check API health
```
